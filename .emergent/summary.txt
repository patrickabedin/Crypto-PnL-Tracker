The trajectory details the evolution of a crypto PnL tracker from a basic concept to a comprehensive, manual-only application. Initially, the AI engineer built the core features, including PnL tracking, KPI management, charts, and Google OAuth. A major challenge involved integrating the Kraken API, which led to debugging MongoDB serialization, duplicate exchange issues, and severe Kraken API rate limiting. After multiple attempts to fix the API integration, the user decided to remove all sync/API functionality, opting for a robust manual-entry system. Post-API removal, the focus shifted to enhancing the UI and analytics: implementing ROI benchmarking (starting balances, total capital), debugging Settings modal data display/edit functionality, adding alternating row colors to Recent Entries, correcting ROI profit/loss messaging, and finally, implementing dark mode, a performance heatmap, and smart alerts. The last interaction before this summary involves a request to color-code Recent Entries rows based on profit/loss.

The user sought a crypto daily PnL performance tracker for inputting wins/losses, calculating profit/loss (absolute/percentage), and tracking daily balances across exchanges (Kraken, Bitget, Binance). Initial features included KPI goals (5K, 10K, 15K), color-coded performance, notes, and historical data.
Subsequent requests led to:
- Avg Daily PnL % and Avg Monthly PnL % cards.
- Interactive charts (portfolio timeline, exchange breakdown, daily PnL).
- CSV export.
- Dynamic exchange management.
- Google OAuth and mobile-first design.
- Dynamic KPI management (add/edit/delete custom goals).
- Whitelabeling (removed Emergent branding).
- Real-time Kraken API integration with secure API key storage and auto-entry (later removed due to issues).
- Setting starting balance for each exchange and total capital deposits for ROI benchmarking.
- UI improvements: alternating row colors for recent entries, correct profit/loss messaging for ROI, dark mode, a performance heatmap calendar, and smart alerts (goal proximity, achievements).

<pending_tasks>
- Apply profit (green) and loss (red) color-coding to entire rows in the Recent Entries tab, for both dark and light modes.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on comprehensively integrating dark mode across the application. All major UI components, including the header, stats cards, ROI cards, smart alerts panel, KPI progress section, Recent Entries section, Performance Heatmap, and all modals/forms, have been updated with dark mode styling, ensuring proper contrast and smooth transitions. The charts were the last major component to receive dark mode styling, including container backgrounds, legend colors, grid lines, and axis labels for the Portfolio Timeline, Exchange Breakdown, and Daily PnL Performance charts. The current specific task is to enhance the Recent Entries section further by color-coding entire rows based on whether the entry represents a profit (green) or a loss (red), in both dark and light themes, to improve visual clarity.

<optional_next_step>
I will implement color-coding for Recent Entries rows based on profit/loss.
