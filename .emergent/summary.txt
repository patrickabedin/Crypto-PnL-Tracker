The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a simple crypto PnL tracker concept into a feature-rich, professional-grade application. Initial work involved building core PnL tracking with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, replicating Excel functionality. Subsequent iterations added interactive charts, data export, dynamic exchange management, and sophisticated monthly/yearly performance analytics. A major enhancement was the integration of secure Google OAuth authentication and a mobile-first responsive design, followed by dynamic KPI management. The application was then fully whitelabeled. The most recent focus has been on real-time Kraken API integration, addressing complex Pydantic serialization issues in the backend, and implementing user-specific API key storage. The current challenge is debugging the incorrect balance display and data not rendering after successful auto-entry creation.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a crypto daily PnL performance tracker to input wins/losses from exchanges and calculate profit/loss in absolute and percentage terms. This evolved into a comprehensive application, replicating Excel functionality including daily balance tracking for multiple exchanges (Kraken, Bitget, Binance), automatic PnL calculations, KPI progress tracking (5K, 10K, 15K goals), color-coded performance, notes, and historical data view.

Further enhancements requested and implemented include:
- An Avg Daily PnL % card on the dashboard.
- Interactive charts (portfolio timeline, exchange breakdown, daily PnL performance).
- CSV export functionality.
- An Avg Monthly PnL % card and monthly/yearly performance tracking (best/worst months).
- Dynamic exchange management (add/remove exchanges).
- Google OAuth authentication and a mobile-first responsive design.
- Dynamic KPI management (add/edit/delete custom goals).
- Whitelabeling (removal of all Emergent branding).
- Real-time API integration for Kraken, with secure API key storage and auto-entry creation.

<pending_tasks>
- Add the frontend interface for User API Key Management, allowing users to add, view, update, and remove their exchange API keys.
- Debug the issue where the synced balance is displayed as €0 and recent entries are not appearing in the frontend despite auto-entry creation working.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the application has successfully integrated real-time Kraken API functionality. Users can click a Sync button to pull live balance data from Kraken, and the Create Entry from Sync function is now working without the previous MongoDB serialization errors. The backend includes secure storage for user-specific API keys and endpoints for managing them.

However, there are two critical issues:
1.  **Balance Display Issue**: The application is showing a total balance of €0, even when the user has funds on Kraken. This indicates a problem with how the fetched Kraken balance is being processed, converted, or displayed in the frontend.
2.  **Entries Not Displaying**: While the auto-entry creation is confirming that an entry for today already exists, these newly created entries (and potentially older ones) are not visible in the Recent Entries section of the dashboard. This suggests an issue with data retrieval or rendering on the frontend after a successful entry creation.

The immediate next step is to investigate these two display/retrieval issues to ensure the synced data is correctly presented to the user.

<optional_next_step>
Check the database and frontend data retrieval logic to fix the €0 balance display and ensure entries appear correctly.
